# This python script should sort photos into folders based on their creation date. If that isn't available, it will use the oldest date in the EXIF data.
# for videos, it will use the creation date from the file metadata.
# It launches a GUI to select the source folder and the destination folder, and then processes the images accordingly.
# The GUI allows the user to select the date format for the folder names and whether it should delete empty folders after processing.
# It is a port to Python from the powershell script PhotoOrganizer_v2/PhotoOrganizer_v2.ps1
